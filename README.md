# Learning outcome
After completing this project, I learned:

- How to develop a test harness to develop a robust evaluation of a model and establish a baseline of performance for a classification task.
- How to explore extensions to a baseline model to improve learning and model capacity.
- How to develop a finalized model, evaluate the performance of the final model, and use it to make predictions on new images.
